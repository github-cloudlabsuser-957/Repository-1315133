**MetaRAGicians Chatbot**

Welcome to the MetaRAGicians Chatbot! This repository contains code for a simple RAG chatbot built using azure cloud environment. This README will guide you through the process of setting up and running the code.

### Overview
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is one of the key techniques used to build chatbots for answering questions on domain data. RAG consists of two components: a retrieval model and an answer generation model based on LLM. The retrieval model fetches context relevant to the userâ€™s query. The query and the retrieved context are then inputted to the LLM with the appropriate prompt to generate the answer.
